I decided to remember a bit how to handle a soldering iron and combine it with the knowledge I gained working as a fullstack. I want to build an internet-controlled machine with [Ackerman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_steering_geometry) steering. The second step is to dive deeper into [ros2](https://github.com/ros2/ros2) and autonomous navigation.
